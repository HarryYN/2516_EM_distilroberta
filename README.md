# 2516_EM_distilroberta
2516 project: using distilroberta to do the entity matching

Our code this time is mainly changed on the basis of the original ditto, the address is: https://github.com/megagonlabs/ditto. If you need to run the distilroberta-based model, you need to put the dataset.py, ditto.py, matcher.py and other files in the corresponding location, and then call.

If you need to use back translation, you can call the corresponding program separately. The result after running is saved in the file called data 

If you need to use the new method of summarization, you need to replace the file of summarize.py in the original file of ditto
